# The PsyInf Knowledge Base

If you are looking for solutions, please visit the knowledge base at
https://knowledge-base.psychoinformatics.de

If you want to contribute solutions, pelase read on.


The actual knowledge is in the `kbi/` directory. The knowledge base can be
rendered in HTML format by running `make html` in the root of the repository
(requires Sphinx).

## Adding a knowledge base item (KBI)

- Create a new subdirectory in `kbi/` with a zero-padded integer name
  (length-4) that matches the successor of the "highest" present directory
  (check active PRs for possible conflicts)
- Pick the best matching template from the `prototypes/` directory, and copy it
  into the new subdirectory as `index.rst`
- Edit as necessary and propose a PR
