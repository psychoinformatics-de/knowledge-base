KBI0001: Security considerations for accessing shared datasets on multi-user machines
=====================================================================================

Overview
--------

Some users who want to clone Git repositories (DataLad datasets) from
locations on a machine that are owned by other users report receiving
an error message containing the following statement::

   fatal: unsafe repository ('/path/to/repository' is owned by someone
   else)

or::

   Git refuses to operate in this repository, probably because it is
   owned by someone else.

The error message comes from Git and also contains the following
suggestion::

   To add an exception for this directory, call:

	git config --global --add safe.directory /path/to/repository

This technical note provides background information about the observed
behavior, and guidance on possible solutions.


Background
----------

Git version 2.35.2 introduced checks for the top-level directory
ownership, and a ``safe.directory`` config option to to bypass these
checks. The changes were also added as patches for minor versions from
2.30 (2.30.3) onwards. Description of the config option can be found
in `git config docs
<https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-safedirectory>`__,
and begins as follows:

   These config entries specify Git-tracked directories that are
   considered safe even if they are owned by someone other than the
   current user. By default, Git will refuse to even parse a Git config
   of a repository owned by someone else, let alone run its hooks, and
   this config setting allows users to specify exceptions, e.g. for
   intentionally shared repositories (see the –shared option in
   git-init). (…)

These are the relevant fragments from Git v2.35.2 and v2.30.3 release
notes (note that changes released together with 2.35.2 were also
applied to older maintenance tracks):

   Git v2.35.2 Release Notes
   =========================

   This release merges up the fixes that appear in v2.30.3,
   v2.31.2, v2.32.1, v2.33.2 and v2.34.2 to address the security
   issue CVE-2022-24765; see the release notes for these versions
   for details.

   Git v2.30.3 Release Notes
   =========================

   This release addresses the security issue CVE-2022-24765.

   Fixes since v2.30.2
   -------------------

    * Build fix on Windows.

    * Fix `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES` with Windows-style root directories.

    * CVE-2022-24765:
      On multi-user machines, Git users might find themselves
      unexpectedly in a Git worktree, e.g. when another user created a
      repository in `C:\.git`, in a mounted network drive or in a
      scratch space. Merely having a Git-aware prompt that runs `git
      status` (or `git diff`) and navigating to a directory which is
      supposedly not a Git worktree, or opening such a directory in an
      editor or IDE such as VS Code or Atom, will potentially run
      commands defined by that other user.

   Credit for finding this vulnerability goes to 俞晨东; The fix was
   authored by Johannes Schindelin.

A message for the commit which introduced the change to Git [1]_ is
more verbose about the reasons - notably mentioning educational
institutes as an example:

::

   commit 8959555cee7ec045958f9b6dd62e541affb7e7d9
   Author: Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>
   Date:   Wed Mar 2 12:23:04 2022 +0100

       setup_git_directory(): add an owner check for the top-level directory
       
       It poses a security risk to search for a git directory outside of the
       directories owned by the current user.
       
       For example, it is common e.g. in computer pools of educational
       institutes to have a "scratch" space: a mounted disk with plenty of
       space that is regularly swiped where any authenticated user can create
       a directory to do their work. Merely navigating to such a space with a
       Git-enabled `PS1` when there is a maliciously-crafted `/scratch/.git/`
       can lead to a compromised account.
       
       The same holds true in multi-user setups running Windows, as `C:\` is
       writable to every authenticated user by default.
       
       To plug this vulnerability, we stop Git from accepting top-level
       directories owned by someone other than the current user. We avoid
       looking at the ownership of each and every directories between the
       current and the top-level one (if there are any between) to avoid
       introducing a performance bottleneck.
       
       This new default behavior is obviously incompatible with the concept of
       shared repositories, where we expect the top-level directory to be owned
       by only one of its legitimate users. To re-enable that use case, we add
       support for adding exceptions from the new default behavior via the
       config setting `safe.directory`.
       
       The `safe.directory` config setting is only respected in the system and
       global configs, not from repository configs or via the command-line, and
       can have multiple values to allow for multiple shared repositories.
       
       We are particularly careful to provide a helpful message to any user
       trying to use a shared repository.

Later changes [2]_, [3]_, citing feedback from users who have a very
large list of shared repositories, introduced the possibility to set
the value of the config option to ``*``, implying that all directories
are safe; or to a directory ending with ``/*``, implying all
repositories under the given directories are safe.

Recommendation
--------------

There are valid situations for cloning a repository from a directory
owned by another user on the same machine (e.g. shared space used for
local dataset distribution, or sharing directly between users). In
such cases, users of recent Git versions will need to declare the
directory cloned from as "safe" with ``git config --global --add
safe.directory ...`` in order to clone it. This is essentially a
declaration of trust, and when doing so, users should consider the
implications explained above.

Since ``safe.directory`` is a Git security mechanism, DataLad will not
set the option automatically, and the decision is left to the user.

For similar reasons, we do not recommend using the ``*`` wildcard
value to declare all directories as safe, although it remains a
possibility for users dealing with a very large number of such
repositories.
A less sweeping alternative is available starting with Git version 2.46.
From this version onward, the ``safe.directory`` configuration also accepts a leading path match, such that users could declare all repositories under a specific path as "safe" (e.g., ``git config --global --add safe.directory /data/projects/*``).

Like any global Git configuration, it is written to the user's
configuration file (typically ``$HOME/.gitconfig``), and its current
value can be shown with ``git config safe.directory``.

Additional comments
-------------------

The KBI applies also, but not only, to repositories set up in Git
shared mode (i.e. allowing users belonging to the same group to push
into the repository). In general, we recommend avoiding this mode for
repository checkouts, as a push by someone may change the worktree
content or git-annex branch content without warning. Whenever
possible, users should create clones only for themselves, e.g. from a
shared bare repository / `RIA store`_.
