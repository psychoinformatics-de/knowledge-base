=================================================================

DataLad versions prior to 1.1.2 can display the
following error when pushing to a RIA store from macOS to a linux
server [#f2]_:

.. code-block:: none

   Unable to remove <remote-store-path>/...//.../transfer/<annex-key> or to obtain write permission in parent directory. -caused by- stat -f%Dp <remote-store-path>/...//.../transfer failed:
   copy: 1 failed

This can be translated as: DataLad tried to execute the ``stat``
command on Linux, with macOS-specific parameterization (``-f%Dp``).

A fix, together with a set of other improvements to to the RIA
functionality of DataLad, has been released in the DataLad-next
extension, in v.1.4.1 (`changelog`_).

Additionally, the 1.4 release of DataLad-next replaces most of the RIA
implementation, including the ORA special remote, and the
create-sibling-ria command. The new implementation brings uniform
support for Windows clients, progress reporting for uploads and
downloads via SSH, and a faster and more robust behavior for SSH-based
operations (from `changelog`_).

`DataLad-next`_ is a separate Python package (`DataLad extension`_),
and can be installed e.g. with ``pip``. It is also available as a
Debian package [#f3]_. It needs to be enabled (``git
config --global --add datalad.extensions.load next``) after
installation to allow it to override default DataLad behavior.

.. rubric:: Footnotes
.. [#f2] Reported e.g. in this `GitHub issue`_ and this `Neurostars
         thread`_, which prompted this KBI.
.. [#f3] At the moment of writing, the latest version available in
         Debian stable is 1.2.0, which does not contain a fix to the
         issues described above.
